# truncated - World Generation Limits

This Minecraft mod allows you to prevent the world generator from generating new chunks past a defined limit.  
You can set the limit by changing the gamerule `chunkGenerationLimit`.

Requires Fabric API!

## Known Incompatibilities

- Distant Horizons: May crash the game or your whole operating system!
- Other World Generators

Note that this mod messes with Minecraft's chunk generation in a way that may lead to unexpected behaviour,
especially in combination with other mods!

## Supported Minecraft versions

- 1.21.1 / Fabric with Fabric API
